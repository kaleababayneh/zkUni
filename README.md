zkUni is a privacy-preserving university admissions system that computes fair student-college matches using the Gale-Shapley algorithm within a Noir ZK circuit. It ensures optimal pairings—no student and college would prefer each other over their assigned match—while keeping preferences hidden. Matches are encrypted with ElGamal, allowing only intended recipients (students and colleges) to decrypt their results, safeguarding sensitive data.

The system leverages a zero-knowledge proof to verify that the matching and encryption are correct without revealing any private information, making it ideal for secure, trustless admissions process. By combining stable matching’s fairness with ZK privacy, zkUni offers a robust alternative to traditional systems where data leaks or bias can compromise fairness, ensuring both transparency and confidentiality in a zero knowledge manner.
